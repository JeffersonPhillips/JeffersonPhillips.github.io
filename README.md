Hello there!
This is the first version of my personal site. I will be adding more features constantly.
Feel free to read and use my code; however, if you implement a big part of it into your own projects, please cite the source (just include https://jeffersonphillips.github.io/ in your sources).
Plagiarism is bad, and no one likes bad people.

Feel free to contact me :)
